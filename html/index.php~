	<h3>Quinn</h3>
        <img src='quinn.JPG' alt='quinn'> <br>
	1992, 13.3h Welsh/POA cross.<br><br>
	Don't you just want to give her a hug?  Quinn really enjoys being our main lesson
	pony. She loves children and is calm enough for short stirrup leadline, and handy
	enough for intermediate students.  She is also sturdy enough for the average 
	adult to ride her.<br>
	<br>
	<h3>Sara Jane</h3>
        <img src='sara.JPG'  alt='sara'><br>
	2000, 15h Missouri Fox Trotter<br><br>
	Sara Jane is Trevor's Horse.  She is a real sweetheart and great for novice and 
	intermediate lessons.  She has allergies so we try to limit her summertime lessons.
	<br>
	<h3>Phoebe</h3>
	<img src='phoebe.JPG' alt='phoebe'><br>
	1994, 15.2h Paint<br>
	Phoebe is a retired show horse.  She is our newest horse, and is now available for novice riders.  Thank you
	to all the students who helped get her back in shape.
	<br>
	<h3>O'Fudge</h3>
	<img src='fudge.JPG' alt='fudge'><br>
	1991, 16h Shire/Thoroughbred cross<br><br>
	Fudge and Val grew up in the show world together.  She is mostly just Val's horse,  
	but she is available for the right type of rider for more advanced lessons.
	<br>
	<h3>Hugo</h3>
	<img src='hugo.JPG' alt='hugo'><br>
	2007, 15h Mustang mix<br><br>
	Val is still training Hugo.  Hopefully someday we can use him for lessons. He is still  
	too unpredictable under saddle, but he LOVES people.

	<p>  Hi, I'm Valerie Jones and this is my husband Trevor. In 2006 we moved from the Youngstown area to our farm in Huntington 
	township. Trevor is a computer systems engineer and works in Cleveland. I have a degree in zoology, concentrating mostly on 
	animal behavior and physiology. When the economy took a turn for the worse I decided to become self employed.

	<p>  My mom introduced me to riding at the age of 8, by 11 I was hooked. I had the pleasure of training with Tina Costarella, 
	 Linda Vaughn, and Colleen Campbell of Mahoning County. At the age of 13 I was training thoroughbreds for Sunbridge Farm under 
	the watchful eye 
	of my mentor Colleen. I have shown 4-H and open hunter most of my teen years, and have been teaching since I was 16. 
	While I am not certified as an instructor, I feel that my experiences in the horse world more than make up for it. 
	I truly enjoy teaching others how to ride and communicate with horses.

	<ul>
	  <li>What do I need to bring with me for a lesson?<br>
	    We supply tack (saddles, bridles etc.).  You should wear boots or shoes with a heel, long pants (jeans are fine) and bring
	      a helmet if you have one.</li><br>
	  <li>Can I bring my own saddle or tack?<br>
	    Yes, bring it with you and we can see if it fits the horse you are using.  Thoroughbred or Arabian saddles won't fit
	      any of our horses.</li><br>
	  <li>Do you offer boarding?<br>
	    Not right now, but if we have enough interest we will be building more stalls.</li><br>
	  <li>Do you offer lessons all year?<br>
	    Even though we do not have an indoor arena, we offer lessons all year.  Dress appropriately for the seasons.</li><br>
	  <li>Can I buy or pay for lessons in advance?<br>
	    We offer gift certificates.  You don't save anything by paying in advance and it is difficult to keep track of so it is not
	      encouraged.</li><br>
	  <li>Can I bring a friend?<br>
	    Yes, they just have to sign the liability waiver even if they are not riding.  If they are riding please let us know in advance.</li><br>
	  <li>Can I just stop over and get a lesson?<br>
	    No, please call and schedule.  Allowing people to just stop over will lead to conflicts, plus Val isn't always available.  
	    You can call the same day, we just can't guarantee Val will be available.</li><br>
	  <li>Why don't I get to pick which horse I ride?<br>
	    For your free first lesson, Val will pick which horse you ride.  People tend to exaggerate about their riding ability, and we don't
	     want anyone getting hurt.  </li><br>
	  <li>Can we lease your horses?<br>
	     No, our horses are not available for lease or sale.</li><br>
	  <li>Can we use your horses at a show?<br>
	    No, we are not a show barn.</li><br>
	  <li>Can I ride Hugo?<br>
	     No.  Hugo is not a lesson horse.  Please do not call and ask if you can ride him.  He is too young to be used as a lesson horse.</li><br>
	  <li>I found a horse I want to buy, can you come and look at it with me?<br>
	      For students and their families, yes. Gas money or lunch would be appreciated.  For non-students there will be a fee.</li><br>
	  <li>Do I have to pick out the stalls and clean tack?<br>
	      No, only if you really want to or have time to kill.  You would not be charged for that as lesson time.</li><br>

	<h4>Sunrise Farm</b><br>
	\"riding for the rest of us\"</h4>

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here at Sunrise Farm you wont find a trophy room full of blues and reds, nor will you find a calender ladened with 
	the coming show season schedule. But you will find laughter, smiles and a great respect for our four legged friends. The most important part 
	about riding, (other than safety) is that it should be fun. 
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our small backyard barn teaches the art of riding through classical horsemanship and encourages students to work as 
	a team with their horse. We are all different and learn at various paces, as do our horses. Lesson take place in the arena, woods or field 
	depending on the student's riding ability and Ohio's ever changing weather. 
	All students learn to ride from the \"ground up\" meaning that they learn how to handle and care for their horse, not just ride. 
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barn as a community enjoys having fun and working together as a team. We have recently added Mounted Game Nite to our activity list. Students work in teams
	of two or three as they learn to master the skills of The United States Pony Club Mounted Games.  Other activities include mounted scavenger hunts, horse maintenance 
	clinics, hunter paces (coming soon), and our yearly Pumpkin Party. Students are always welcome to help out around the barn.
